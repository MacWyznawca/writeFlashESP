writeFlashESP and readFlashESP

**Function that allow multiple write to flash memory with a significantly reduced number of erase cycles!**

nr_of_sectors = 2 (8KB), nr_of_words = 2 (8 Bytes) are 1024 write of 6 Bytes user data for one erase cycle!

Functions for ESP8266, ESP8285 for NON_OS. They also work with FreeRTOS and Arduino.

*********************************************************************
* nr_of_sectors - Blocs are 32 bit (4 byte) pices of flash memory. More blocks less erase flash and long live of module
* nr_of_words - Data block lenght by 32 bit words. Two blocks are 8 bytes (1 Magic,6 for user, 1 for crc)
* 'sector_address' may by: uint32_t sector_address = (SYSTEM_PARTITION_RF_CAL_ADDR / 0x1000) - nr_of_sectors;
* magic_byte // some characteristic number for search user data
*********************************************************************

* 1024 % nr_of_words must be 0 (nr_of_words may be: 1, 2, 4, 8â€¦x)
* Number of write to flash witout erase: (nr_of_sectors * 1024) / nr_of_words
* nr_of_sectors = 2, nr_of_words = 2 are 1024 write of 6 bytes user data for one erase cycle!

*********************************************************************
* **You have for data (nr_of_words * 4) - 2**
* **For 2 words You have 6 bytes, for 4 words You have 14 bytes**
