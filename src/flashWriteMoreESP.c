/*
writeFlashESP and readFlashESP

Function that allow multiple write to flash memory with a significantly reduced number of erase cycles.
nr_of_sectors = 2 (8KB), nr_of_words = 2 (8 Bytes) are 1024 write of 6 Bytes user data for one erase cycle!

Functions for ESP8266, ESP8285 for NON_OS
They should also work with FreeRTOS and Arduino.
Arduino needs to be added: extern "C"

*********************************************************************
* nr_of_sectors - Sectors has 1024 word (x4 byte) of flash memory (4096 Bytes). More sectors less erase flash and long live of module
* nr_of_words - Data block lenght by 32 bit words. Two words are 8 bytes (1 Magic, 6 for user, 1 for crc). Free bytes for user is ((nr_of_words * 4) - 2)
* 'sector_address' may by: uint32_t sector_address = (SYSTEM_PARTITION_RF_CAL_ADDR / 0x1000) - nr_of_sectors;
* magic_byte // some characteristic number for search user data
*********************************************************************

* nr_of_words now can be any ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5â€¦) les than 256.
* Number of write to flash witout erase: (nr_of_sectors * 1024) / nr_of_words
* nr_of_sectors = 2, nr_of_words = 2 are 1024 write of 6 bytes user data for one erase cycle!

*********************************************************************
!!!! You have for own data (nr_of_words * 4) - 2.                !!!!
!!!! For 2 words You have 6 bytes, for 4 words You have 14 bytes !!!!
